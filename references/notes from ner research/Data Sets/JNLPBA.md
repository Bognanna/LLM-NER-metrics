description: JNLPBA is a biomedical dataset that comes from the GENIA version 3.02 corpus (Kim et al., 2003). It was created with a controlled search on MEDLINE. From this search 2,000 abstracts were selected and hand annotated according to a small taxonomy of 48 classes based on a chemical classification. 36 terminal classes were used to annotate the GENIA corpus.
