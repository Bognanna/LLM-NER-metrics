## Intuition

## Problems
- lack of mechanism to differantiate between similar and dissimilar word-pair representations (missclasification of complex scattered entity spans) [[TriG-NER - Triplet-Grid Framework for Discontinuous Named Entuty Recognition]]
-  constrained by reliance on specific grid tag design and decoding structure [[TriG-NER - Triplet-Grid Framework for Discontinuous Named Entuty Recognition]]
