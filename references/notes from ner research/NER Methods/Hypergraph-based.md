## Intuition
Aim to build more effective inference systems by modeling the structure as a whole graph. Represent all entity spans.

## Problems
- Spurious structure [[Unified Named Entity Recognition as Word-Word Relation Classification]]
- Structural (decoding) ambiguity issue [[Rethinking Boundaries End-To-End Recognition of Discontinuous Mentions with Pionter Networks]] [[Unified Named Entity Recognition as Word-Word Relation Classification]]
- Need to manually define graph nodes and edges [[A Span-Based Model for Joint Overlapped and Discontiunuous Named Entity Recognition
- Error propagation [[A Span-Based Model for Joint Overlapped and Discontiunuous Named Entity Recognition]]
