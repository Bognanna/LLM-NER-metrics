## Intuition
Directly generate various entities.

## Problems
- Decoding efficiency problem [[Unified Named Entity Recognition as Word-Word Relation Classification]]
- Common shortages of Seq2Seq architecture, e.g. exposure bias. [[Unified Named Entity Recognition as Word-Word Relation Classification]]
