## Intuition
Enumerate all possible spans and perform span-level classification.

## Problems
- Considerable model complexity
- Ignorance of boundary information,
- Under-utilization of the spans that partially match with entities,
- Difficulties in long entity recognition (maximal span lenghts)

## Examples
