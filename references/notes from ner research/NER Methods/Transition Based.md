## Intuition
Aim to build more effective inference systems by modeling the transition system. Incrementally label the discontinuois spans through a sequence of shift-reduce actions.

## Problems
- Exposure bias [[Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition as Maximal Clique Discovery]]
- Long-distance dependency issue <- local and incremental decision-making mechanism [[Rethinking Boundaries End-To-End Recognition of Discontinuous Mentions with Pionter Networks ]]
- Need to manually define transition actions. [[A Span-Based Model for Joint Overlapped and Discontiunuous Named Entity Recognition]]
- Error propagation [[A Span-Based Model for Joint Overlapped and Discontiunuous Named Entity Recognition]]
